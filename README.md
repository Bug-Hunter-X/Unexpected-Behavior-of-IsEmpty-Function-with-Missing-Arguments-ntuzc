This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the IsEmpty function when used with optional or missing function arguments. The bug occurs when a function is called without providing a value for a parameter that is not explicitly declared as optional. In such cases, IsEmpty might not correctly identify the parameter as empty, leading to unexpected behavior or errors within the function. The solution demonstrates a more robust method to handle missing or empty arguments using a combination of IsMissing and IsEmpty functions.
